Hello,

I wish you all a happy and healthy new year :)

For this version, I would like to especially thanks Carsten Elton Sørensen (aka [@csoren](https://github.com/csoren) on github) for his pull requests!

### Improvements ###

- PR \#270 fixes \#259: Since notepad++ v7.6.4, UDL can be shipped in several .xml files, alongside the existing userDefineLang.xml (see [this release note](notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/17072/new-enhancement-for-user-defined-language-system/19)).
- PR \#271: Adding line break support for keyword / function documentation in the auto completion (see [notepad++ documentation regarding this feature](https://npp-user-manual.org/docs/auto-completion/#auto-completion-file-format)).

### Fixed issues ###

- \#272, \#269: the new minimum version of notepad++ required is now 7.7.

See you soon and in the meantime, enjoy!
