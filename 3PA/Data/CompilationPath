# Modify this file freely, it allows to reroute the destination path of an .r file
# after a program compilation
# 
# each line contains 4 info separated by tabulations :
# application_name	application_suffix	source_path_to_match	path_to_append_to_compilation_dir
#
# you can filter the application to which this rerouting applies with the two
# first fields
# the application name, as well as the application suffix can be left blank
# in that case, the rerouting will be applied for every compilation
#
# For instance, if i have the following line :
# 		src\client-sources\	client\
# If i compile a source file located in D:\Repo\src\client-sources\
# if my compilation (in set environment) is D:\SVN\
# the .r file will be moved to : D:\SVN\client\
# since the 2 first fields are left blank, this setting applies for everything i compile
# easy right?!
