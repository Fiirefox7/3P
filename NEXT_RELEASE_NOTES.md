**Improvements :**

- New options for the deployment :
  - You can now send files to a .cab file (works like zip rules)
  - Changed the behavior of the `display parser errors on save`, the notification now allows you to disable the feature for the current file only

**Fixed issues :**

- #160, #161 : problems with prototype synchronization in include files
- #162 : no fields available on the autocompletion for buffers
